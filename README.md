A final project in Wildau IT Welcome School made by Vladyslav Omelchenko.
# Introduction
In my project I compared two different classification methods using [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris): Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbours.

I had to use PCA model for this dataset, but because of even distribution of data the first task was to convert multiclass classification into binary classification.

# Result

These are results for both Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers:
